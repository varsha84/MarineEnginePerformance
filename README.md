# MarineEnginePerformance

## Project Structure
- **Controllers** handle incoming requests and expose endpoints.
- **Model** defines engine parameters and performance-related data structures.
- **Data** manages database access and persistence.
- **Manager** contains core business and calculation logic.
- **Interfaces** ensure loose coupling and testability.
- **Migrations** track database schema changes.

This structure supports **scalable backend development**, clear responsibility separation, and easy extension for future performance and efficiency models.

## Description
This project is a backend-focused application for analyzing **marine engine performance**.  
It processes engine parameters and applies calculation logic to generate performance and efficiency indicators.

The project demonstrates working with **engineering-driven, domain-heavy data** in a clean and maintainable backend structure.

## Features
- Marine engine performance calculations  
- Structured data models for engine parameters  
- Clear separation of calculation logic and data handling  
- Focus on accuracy, maintainability, and extensibility  

## Technical Focus
- Backend-oriented design  
- Data modeling and performance calculations  
- Engineering-style problem solving
